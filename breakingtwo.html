            <h1>Breaking The Two-Hour Marathon Barrier</h1>
                <p>In Vienna, the Kenyan runner Eliud Kipchoge was able to surpass the unbreakable barrier of the sub two-hour marathon. He ran a 1:59:40 on the misty Sunday morning of October 12, 2019. The barrier that Eliud has broken will however not be recognized as a world record. He is only 34 years of age and has just broken a record that would have been considered impossible just a few years ago. The eight-time marathon winner and three-time olympic gold medalist pounded on his chest twice while crossing the finish line. As he crossed he ran to his wife and children. The time his team had set to achieve was 1:59:50, Eliud had beaten the set out time by 10 whole seconds. Members of the team and pace setters were excited and emotional once the race was completed. "Looking at the 1:59:40 time, I got so emotional", said Lagat, a two-time Olympic medalist. This has been a barrier for years, now people wonder, what  will be the next record to come?</p>
